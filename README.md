<p>- Enjoy
<p>I make a changes in installer and autoupdater to  copy all files to install dir, run autoupdate and start RDPConf to check if it works.
Also i change the uninstaller to remove install dir.</b>

I like to use it, and now (from build 18362.836) i try to make it working on every release x64 by myself.
